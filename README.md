- 👋 Hi, I’m @R2Pitou
- 👀 I’m interested in **JS**, Firebase, headless/serverless/stateless **cloud deployment**, **AI** and machine learning... Ohh and Python I guess... 😅
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the **very basics or Javascript**. After reading about Google cloud, AWS and all the smaller SAAS offerings,
      feels dumb to build yet another Wordpress site that's humming 24/7 on the same metal it was allocated, visitors or no visitors. There has to be a better way.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Stable Diffusion. Want to start an app to leave my little mark. Need to learn JS and Python first... 
      ChatGPT hasn't managed to code me so much as a functional Chrome extension yet.
- 📫 How to reach me? Here... My dev site isn't ready yet, so no fancy domain emails.
