# 👋 Hi, I’m @R2Pitou

https://r2p2.link/hellob 👋++ Graphic designer, AI nerd, Digital Transformation Supervisor, charity thespian, artist, and antijovial introvert.

-   Digital Transformation Supervisor, serial tinkerer, part-time chaos wrangler.
-   I mess with **JavaScript**, **Python**, Firebase, **serverless/headless/stateless** cloud deployments, and AI/ML projects that actually get used.
-   My allergy to the **WordPress + LAMP stack** has faded into a begrudging acceptance. I'm now planning a deploy for a largish school, proving that even I can't escape the monolith... which is separate from the *other* WordPress + LAMP stack I run on Plesk, still burning power that LLMs haven't yet hogged.
-   I hate Google Cloud’s UI. It’s as intuitive as a Yamaha surround sound amp’s remote — a mishmash of rectangles in a random order, and one of them is orange just for fun.
-   Currently learning **Nothing** properly thanks to vibing, building small SysOps tools with AI, and finding ways to make Google Workspace (and now, a LAMP stack) behave for entire schools without losing my sanity.
-   Interested in collaborations where the tech is lean, the scope is realistic, and the end result isn’t a white elephant? (I'm not your guy.)
-   Reach me: [info+github@atp2.stream](mailto:info+github@atp2.stream). (I fail to see why you would)

I got my first ever accepted PR and it felt like a milestone! I know I wasn't contributing any code (Unless we count hex code), but I managed to follow the steps, and gave a compelling enough reason for it, that I am not the proud father of [Alien Conspiracy Pink #f023bc!](https://github.com/meodai/color-names/pull/234)
