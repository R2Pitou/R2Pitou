### About Me

I'm a Digital Transformation Supervisor, serial tinkerer, and part-time chaos wrangler. I enjoy messing with JavaScript, Python, Firebase, and various serverless/headless/stateless cloud deployments. I also have a passion for AI/ML projects that actually get used.

I have a begrudging acceptance of the WordPress + LAMP stack and I'm currently planning a deployment for a large school. I also run another WordPress + LAMP stack on Plesk. I'm not a fan of Google Cloud's UI, but I'm learning to live with it.

I'm currently learning Nothing properly, thanks to vibing, building small SysOps tools with AI, and finding ways to make Google Workspace (and now, a LAMP stack) behave for entire schools without losing my sanity.

I got my first ever PR merge in Dec 2025 and it felt like a milestone! I know I wasn't contributing any code (Unless we count hex code), but I managed to follow the steps, and gave a compelling enough reason for it, that made me the proud father of [Alien Conspiracy Pink (#f023bc)!](https://github.com/meodai/color-names/pull/234)
