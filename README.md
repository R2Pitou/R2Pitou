# 👋 Hi, I’m @R2Pitou

https://r2p2.link/hellob 👋++ Graphic designer, AI nerd, Digital Transformation Supervisor, charity thespian, artist, and antijovial introvert.

- Digital Transformation Supervisor, serial tinkerer, part-time chaos wrangler.
- I mess with **JavaScript**, **Python**, Firebase, **serverless/headless/stateless** cloud deployments, and AI/ML projects that actually get used.
- Still allergic to the idea of a **WordPress + LAMP stack** idling on some unscalable metal, burning power for the five people who visit in a month, but still using exclusively Wordpress + LAMP stack running in Plesk Server on some bare metal burning power that LLM's have not yet managed to hog.
- I hate Google Cloud’s UI. It’s as intuitive as a Yamaha surround sound amp’s remote — a mishmash of rectangles in a random order, and one of them is orange just for fun.
- Currently learning **JS** properly, wiring up **API automations**, and finding ways to make Google Workspace behave for entire schools without losing my sanity.
- Interested in collaborations where the tech is lean, the scope is realistic, and the end result isn’t a white elephant.
- Reach me: [info+github@atp2.stream](mailto:info+github@atp2.stream).
